# lane_finding_basic
Overview:
This is project submission for Udacity's Self-Driving nanodegree program.

This repository contains code to detect lane lines on road using computer vision algorithms. 
The code is written in Python using Jupyter notebook framework.
A lot of helper functions were provided by Udacity

It uses basic computer vision algorithms like edge detection and Hough transforms to detect lane boundaries from video taken by camera mounted on top of a car.
The output is video with lane boundaries marked in red color
