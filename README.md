# lane_finding_basic
This repository contains code to detect lane lines on road using computer vision algorithms. 
The code is written in Python using Jupyter notebook framework

It uses basic computer vision algorithms like edge detection and Hough transforms to detect lane boundaries from video taken by camera mounted on top of a car.
The output is video with lane boundaries marked in red color
